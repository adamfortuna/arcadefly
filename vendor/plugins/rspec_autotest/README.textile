h1. Rspec AutoTest Rails Plug In

This is a copy of the existing *rspec_autotest* plug in for rails, that I think is way outdated, I had to modify 
it to grab the list of files from @@@*find_order* instead of from @@@*files*, also the name of the methods that 
generate the list of tests to run, was changed from *test_for_files()* to *test_files_for()*.

Also, I stumbled upon the problem that it was not generating the color codes in _Ubuntu GNU Linux_, after 
unsuccessfully taking a dive thru google, I went down the code in the *rspec gem* (specifically version 1.1.12), 
and found out that all I needed to force color display on linux when spec is not run from tty (as it is when run 
in autotest), was to add *AUTOTEST=true* to the environment so, basically all you need is to run spec autotest 
like this:

*AUTOTEST=true rake spec:autotest*

or set it directly in your environment:

*export AUTOTEST=true*

Et voila!, colors will be forced, and correctly displayed in autotest.

*Greetings!*
